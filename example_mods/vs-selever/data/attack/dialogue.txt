L|selever|Hey, you did it. You did it without having to write huge paragraphs of rants this time.
L|selever:smug|Not bad, Roachy, not bad at all.
R|bf|Be boop pi pa
L|selever:moody|Uh, what is it?
R|bf:happy|Pa boo bep pi skee pa
L|selever:moody|Well, I didn't say all songs were going to be brand new.
L|selever:moody|It's not like I was offering them some cash, dude. I don't care about details that much. A mod is a mod.
R|bf|Bap pa boop
L|selever:moody|... I'd watch my words if I were you, buddy.
L|selever:smug|Unless you want to give Roachy here a bad time, that is.
R|bf|Be boop skee boo pi pa bep poo
L|selever:moody|Dude, what?
R|bf|Be boop skee boo pi pa bep poo
L|selever:upset|What the hell is wrong with you?
R|bf:happy|Be boop skee boo pi pa bep poo
L|selever:upset|Yeah, it's so easy for you to say that crap with Roachy here backing you up.
L|selever:moody|Modders keep taking you to all kinds of\nplaces, and when you screw up Roachy comes in to get you out of trouble.
L|selever:moody|Meanwhile mom and dad are erased from\nexistence, all because of some jerks who can't take a damn joke.
L|selever:upset|Thanks to them, me and my sister are going to stay trapped in here... most likely forever.
R|bf|Boo bap?
L|selever:angry|Of course I'm mad! I'm pissed! How could you not expect that to make me angry?
R|bf:happy|Uuh, pa boop pi bep
L|selever:angry|I couldn't give any less fucks if that's clich√©, dude. You started it! You always do!
L|selever:upset|From your insistence on talking like a baby to the actual words you mean to say, you're insufferable all the same.
L|selever:upset|But hey, since reason just doesn't work with you; let's see how you like this instead, you cocky little freak!
