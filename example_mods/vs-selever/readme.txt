 FNF: VS Selever 2.0                                       Now on Psych Engine!
================================================================================
 Most features of this mod have been ported by making use of Psych Engine's
 external formats and Lua script API. As such, this mod should be playable with
 a regular PE executable and in tandem with other mods.
 
 There are some other features however that had to be ported via source code,
 so those will not be present if this mod is played without its bundled
 executable:
 
 - Story mode dialogues (the mod uses the same autoload routine than the Kade
   Engine build, instead of a lua script).
 - Character-specific talk sounds.
 - Mid-Fight Masses Crossfade, also known as the Week 6's Evil Trail.
 - Language support with extended character set.

 El Team Style wishes you a Happy New Year! We hope you enjoy the mod, or rage
 hard about it... both options make noise and thus help us.
 
 We once more reiterate that this is merely a fan made week of a fangame, none
 of this is canon to either Friday Night Funkin' or Mid-Fight Masses, and we
 are not associated to the staff behind any of those games.
 
 We will return next year with new productions, this time more original than a
 fanmade week, of course.
 
 Live and let mod!
================================================================================
 DISCLAIMER: The following mod may contain minor flashing lights, adult
 language, hellish charts and pop references that make it unsuitable for
 children. If you're below 13 years of age... What on Earth are you doing here,
 boy? At least ask your parents to watch over you while you play, hehe.
